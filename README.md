# Rossman-Store-Sales-Prediction-with-XGBoost

Rossman is a big brand with many stores across many cities. We will try to predict the sales a store can achieve doing some data pre-processing, data visualization,
feature engineering and making the actual prediction with XGBoost.

This project is not owned by me. It is a replication of work while I was following a tutorial/online course on Udemy. The notebook is sligtly changed and improved by me.
The purpose of that repository is to show that I followed and understood a real-world project from more experienced data scientists.
